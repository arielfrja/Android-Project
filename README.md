# Android-Project
A project I made for a android programming course on 3rd year

Hey! this 2 apps of my project.

The secondry project's purpose is to connect between travelers and travel agencies.
But the main purpose is to show that I know how to use Android tools to create apps. Because this reason some of of things created by a worse way than they could be, but they show an Android tool.

This project not built to be smart. for example, I didn't built a real registeration beacuse its not importnat for showing Android programming principles.


for any more questions, I'm in arielfrja@gmail.com.

yours, Ariel.
